# A Gatsby-based, markdown powered, github pages hosted prototype

This repository is home to the source code and static files that power and supply the content for a github pages hosted static site. Creating or editing new pages, adding events, or writing blog posts only require knowledge of markdown, and a simple deploy script will publish the new content.

Markdown files added to the markdown-pages directory will create a new page, and be added to the main nav bar.

Markdown files added to the blog-posts or events directory will create a new blog post or event, and be added to the blog/event pages, and blog post/event nav.
